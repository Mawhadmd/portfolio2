This is a modern chat app that has many features, including authorization, authentication, real-time, image/audio sharing, and more.

I loved the idea of having my own chat app, use it to talk with friends while knowing exactly how each message is reaching the other side. I built a simple chat app back in my junior years using PHP and Ajax, but it wasn't real-time; instead, it was polling every couple of seconds. I consider this an upgrade of that and my most comprehensive project as of July 1, 2025, and I would love to create more projects and applications like this.

A video conferencing app inspired by Zoom, enabling real-time audio, video, and chat functionality.


I was inspired to undertake this project by my previous chat application, Chatty. Surprisingly, this project didnâ€™t take much time (But it took much brain power), and I found it quite enjoyable since it was based on the earlier one. I utilized React for the front end, along with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Peer.js, and Express.js (Socket.io) for the back end.
